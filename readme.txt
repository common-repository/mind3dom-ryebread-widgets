Allows to extend your blog with class-based skinnable ajax-featured widgets, optionally arranged in page areas (containers).

== Description ==

This plugin is designed to perform some simple class-based widget framework in wordpress.
Using it you can write widget classes (or extend some) in object oriented manner. 
There is a simple widget API, defining basic interfaces and classes. AJAX is core-embedded.
After writing your class, you must install it (this is done for the purpose of writing custom database data needed for widget functionality) in order to define widgets of this class.
After defining widgets you can place them directly to your page using wordpress shortcodes or special plugin function.
You can specify skin (special markup) for each widget placement. You can also define containers (or sidebars) and place widgets into them.
Containers are also placed on pages using shortcodes or function call.
